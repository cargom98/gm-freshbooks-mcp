## Your Office Space
- **Office Size:** 182 square feet
- **Method:** Simplified Method
- **Rate:** $5 per square foot

---

## Calculation

The simplified method is an **ANNUAL** deduction, not monthly.

```
Annual Home Office Deduction = Office Square Feet × $5 per year

182 sq ft × $5 = $910 per year
```

**Your Home Office Deduction for 2025: $910**

### Common Misconception
❌ **NOT** $910 per month ($10,920 per year)  
✅ **YES** $910 per year total

The $5 rate is per square foot **per year**, not per month.

## Comparison: Simplified vs. Actual Expense Method

**Your Office:** 182 sq ft

### Simplified Method
- **Deduction:** $910
- **Forms Required:** None (just enter on Schedule C Line 30)
- **Complexity:** Very simple

### Actual Expense Method (Estimated)
To beat the simplified method, your home expenses would need to exceed:

```
Required Annual Home Expenses = $910 ÷ Business Use %

Example scenarios:
- If home is 1,500 sq ft: 182÷1,500 = 12.1% → Need $7,520+ in home expenses
- If home is 2,000 sq ft: 182÷2,000 = 9.1% → Need $10,000+ in home expenses
- If home is 2,500 sq ft: 182÷2,500 = 7.3% → Need $12,466+ in home expenses
```

**For most situations with 182 sq ft office, the simplified method is optimal.**
