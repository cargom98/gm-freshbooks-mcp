## Three Options for Deducting Your Furniture

### Option 1: Section 179 Immediate Expensing (RECOMMENDED)
**Deduct the full $1,078.67 in 2025**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Immediate full deduction in 2025
- ✅ Reduces 2025 taxable income
- ✅ Simple - one-time deduction
- ✅ No depreciation tracking needed in future years
- ✅ Maximum tax benefit now when you have income

**How to Report:**

- Transfer to Schedule C, Line 13 (Depreciation)

**Tax Savings:**

---

### Option 2: Regular Depreciation (7-Year Property)
**Spread deduction over 7 years**

Office furniture is classified as 7-year property under MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System).

**2025 Deduction (Year 1):**
- Using Half-Year Convention: $1,078.67 × 14.29% = **$154.14**

**Future Years:**
- Year 2: $1,078.67 × 24.49% = $264.16
- Year 3: $1,078.67 × 17.49% = $188.66
- Years 4-8: Declining amounts

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Smaller deduction in 2025 ($154 vs $1,078)
- ❌ Must track depreciation for 7 years
- ❌ More complex record-keeping
- ❌ Delayed tax benefit

---

### Option 3: Bonus Depreciation (If Available)
**100% first-year deduction**

Bonus depreciation may allow 100% deduction in year 1 for qualifying property.

**Status for 2025:** Bonus depreciation rules have been changing. Check with your tax preparer if this is still available at 100% for 2025.

**If Available:**
- Similar to Section 179 but different form treatment
- Report on Form 4562, Part II

## Updated Schedule C with Section 179

### Current Treatment (Office Expenses)
| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Office Expenses (Line 18) | $1,078.67 |
| Depreciation (Line 13) | $0.00 |

### Recommended Treatment (Section 179)
| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|

## Impact on Your Net Profit

### Current Calculation (Already Included)
Your Schedule C already includes the $1,078.67 as an office expense, so it's already reducing your taxable income.

**Current Net Profit:** $6,567.10 (with home office deduction)

### If You Use Section 179
The deduction amount stays the same ($1,078.67), just reported on a different line:
- Move from Line 18 (Office Expenses) to Line 13 (Depreciation)
- **Net Profit remains:** $6,567.10

**No change to net profit - just better tax treatment and documentation.**

## What You Need to Do

### For Your Tax Preparer:

1. **Provide Documentation:**
   - Receipt from SP Branch Furniture ($1,078.67)
   - Date placed in service: July 5, 2025
   - Description: Office furniture for home office
   - Business use: 100%

2. **Request Section 179 Treatment:**

3. **Confirm Eligibility:**
   - Furniture is used exclusively for business
   - Furniture was placed in service in 2025
   - You have sufficient business income to claim the deduction

---

## Important Limitations

### Section 179 Cannot Exceed Business Income
Your business income (before Section 179): $7,477.10  
Your Section 179 deduction: $1,078.67  
✅ **You qualify** - deduction is less than income

### If Business Income Were Lower
If your net profit were less than $1,078.67, you could only deduct up to your net profit amount. The excess would carry forward to next year.

**Example:**
- If net profit = $500
- Section 179 deduction = $1,078.67
- Can deduct: $500 in 2025
- Carryforward: $578.67 to 2026

## Additional Notes

- Section 179 is an election, not automatic - you must choose it
- Once elected, you cannot change it without IRS permission
- Keep records of the furniture purchase for at least 7 years
- If you later use the furniture less than 50% for business, you may have to recapture the deduction
