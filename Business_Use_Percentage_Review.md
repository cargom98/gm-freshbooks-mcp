## IRS Requirements

### The Rule
You can only deduct the **business use percentage** of phone and internet expenses if they're used for both business and personal purposes.

### Questions to Consider:

1. **Do you have a separate business phone line?**
   - ✅ YES → Can deduct 100% of business line
   - ❌ NO → Must calculate business use percentage

2. **Do you have a separate business internet connection?**
   - ✅ YES → Can deduct 100% of business internet
   - ❌ NO → Must calculate business use percentage

3. **Is this your home phone/internet used for both business and personal?**
   - If YES → Must prorate based on business use

---

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Separate Business Services (100% Deductible)
**If you have:**
- Dedicated business phone line (AT&T)
- Dedicated business internet (Frontier)
- Used exclusively for business

**Then:** ✅ Current deduction is correct ($2,630.48)

---

### Scenario 2: Mixed Use (Must Prorate)
**If you have:**
- One phone line used for business AND personal
- One internet connection used for business AND personal

**Then:** ❌ Must calculate business use percentage

#### Example Calculation:
If business use is 80%:
- AT&T: $1,379.84 × 80% = $1,103.87
- Frontier: $1,160.92 × 80% = $928.74
- **Adjusted Total:** $2,032.61
- **Reduction:** $597.87

---

### Scenario 3: Home Office with Simplified Method
**Important Note:**

You're using the **Simplified Method** for home office deduction ($910). This method is designed to cover a portion of:
- Utilities (including internet)
- Rent/mortgage
- Insurance
- Repairs

**Potential Issue:**
If you're deducting internet separately AND using the simplified home office method, you might be **double-dipping**.

#### IRS Guidance:
When using the simplified method, you generally should NOT separately deduct:
- Home internet (if it's your home connection)
- Utilities already covered by the $5/sq ft rate

**Exception:** Business-specific services like:
- Dedicated business phone line
- Web hosting (Cloudflare) ✅
- Business-specific internet service

---

## Recommended Actions

### Option A: Keep Current Deductions (If Applicable)
**Only if:**
1. AT&T is a dedicated business phone line (not your personal phone)
2. Frontier is a dedicated business internet connection (separate from home internet)
3. These services are used 100% for business

**Documentation needed:**
- Separate bills showing business account
- Evidence of exclusive business use

---

### Option B: Adjust for Mixed Use
**If services are used for both business and personal:**

1. **Calculate Business Use Percentage**
   - Track business vs. personal usage for a representative period
   - Common percentages: 50-80% for home-based businesses

2. **Apply Percentage to Expenses**
   ```
   Deductible Amount = Total Cost × Business Use %
   ```

3. **Update Schedule C**
   - Reduce utilities deduction accordingly
   - Document your calculation method

---

### Option C: Use Actual Expense Method for Home Office
**If you want to maximize deductions:**

Consider switching from Simplified Method to Actual Expense Method (Form 8829):
- Calculate actual home expenses
- Apply business use percentage
- May result in larger deduction
- Properly accounts for internet/utilities

**Trade-off:**
- More complex
- Requires Form 8829
- Must track depreciation

---

## Specific Concerns

### 1. AT&T - $1,379.84
**Question:** Is this a dedicated business line or your personal phone used for business?

**If personal phone:**
- IRS allows 100% deduction of ADDITIONAL business line
- Cannot deduct personal phone even if used for business
- Can deduct business-specific charges (long distance, data overages for business)

**If business line:**
- ✅ 100% deductible

---

### 2. Frontier - $1,160.92
**Question:** Is this a separate business internet or your home internet?

**If home internet:**
- Should be included in home office calculation (Form 8829 or simplified method)
- Simplified method already covers this at $5/sq ft
- Separate deduction may be double-counting

**If business internet:**
- ✅ 100% deductible

---

### 3. Cloudflare - $89.72
**Web hosting is clearly business-specific:**
- ✅ 100% deductible
- No adjustment needed
