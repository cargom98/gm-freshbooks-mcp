## How to Calculate Using Form 8829 (Actual Expense Method)

### STEP 1: Measure Your Space

**You Need:**
- Total square footage of your home: _________ sq ft
- Square footage of office space: _________ sq ft

**Calculate Business Use Percentage:**
```
Business Use % = (Office sq ft ÷ Total home sq ft) × 100

Example: 200 sq ft office ÷ 2,000 sq ft home = 10%
```

Your Business Use Percentage: __________%

---

### STEP 2: Gather Direct Expenses (100% Deductible)

Direct expenses benefit ONLY the office space:
- Painting/repairs done only in office
- Office-specific lighting fixtures
- Office-only improvements

**Your Direct Expenses for 2025:** $_________

---

### STEP 3: Gather Indirect Expenses (Multiply by Business Use %)

Indirect expenses benefit the entire home:

| Expense Category | Annual Amount | Business % | Deductible Amount |
|------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Mortgage Interest | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| Property Taxes | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| Homeowners Insurance | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| HOA Fees | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Electric) | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| Utilities (Gas/Heat) | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |

| Pest Control | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |
| Lawn Care | $_________ | _____% | $_________ |

### STEP 4: Calculate Depreciation

**For Homeowners Only** (not renters):

You need:
- Original purchase price of home: $_________
- Cost of land (from property tax records): $_________
- Cost of improvements since purchase: $_________

**Calculate Adjusted Basis:**
```
Adjusted Basis = Purchase Price - Land Value + Improvements
```

**Calculate Annual Depreciation:**
```
Annual Depreciation = (Adjusted Basis × Business Use %) ÷ 39 years
```

Your Annual Depreciation: $_________

**Note:** Depreciation will be recaptured when you sell your home, so discuss with your tax preparer.

---

### STEP 5: Apply Gross Income Limitation

**Important:** The home office deduction cannot create or increase a business loss.

Your 2025 Business Income (from Schedule C): $7,477.10

**Deduction Limit Calculation:**
1. Gross business income: $17,137.50
2. Minus: Business expenses (excluding home office): $9,660.40
3. **Maximum home office deduction allowed:** $7,477.10

If your calculated home office expenses exceed this amount, the excess carries forward to 2026.

---

## Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Home: 2,000 sq ft
- Office: 200 sq ft
- Business Use: 10%

**Expenses:**
- Mortgage Interest: $12,000 × 10% = $1,200
- Property Taxes: $3,000 × 10% = $300
- Insurance: $1,500 × 10% = $150
- Utilities: $2,400 × 10% = $240
- Repairs: $1,000 × 10% = $100
- Depreciation: $200,000 basis × 10% ÷ 39 = $513

**Total Deduction: $2,503**

---

## Comparison: Which Method Should You Choose?

| Factor | Simplified Method | Actual Expense Method |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Maximum Deduction | $1,500 | No limit |
| Record Keeping | Minimal | Extensive |
| Depreciation | None | Required (homeowners) |
| Best For | Small offices, renters | Larger offices, high expenses |
| Form Required | None | Form 8829 |

**Quick Decision:**
- If your office is ≤ 300 sq ft and you want simplicity → **Simplified Method**
- If your office is > 300 sq ft or high home expenses → **Actual Expense Method**

## Important Warnings

⚠️ **Depreciation Recapture:** When you sell your home, you'll pay tax on the depreciation you claimed. Discuss this with your tax preparer.

⚠️ **Rental Property:** If you rent your home, you cannot deduct mortgage interest or depreciation, but you can deduct your portion of rent.

⚠️ **Documentation:** The IRS frequently audits home office deductions. Keep excellent records.
